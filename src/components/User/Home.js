						<div className="abt-head">About Us</div>
						<span className="tab-space"></span>Story Land Library was born out
						of a deep-rooted love for books and community. Growing up, the
						library was a haven for my sister and me, a place where we could
						explore countless worlds and stories. When I moved to the US for my
						Masters, this passion only grew. I often visited local libraries and
						Barnes & Noble, gathering information for class assignments and
						indulging in books of personal interest.
						<br />

								<span className="tab-space"></span>What I cherished most about
								US libraries was their extensive collections catering to all age
								groups. One could spend hours at the library or borrow as many
								books as needed to enjoy at home. My understanding of children's
								activities at libraries expanded when I had my own child. When
								my son was about six months old, I discovered story-telling
								sessions at our local library. These sessions became a favorite
								for both of us. They provided my son with entertainment and me
								with an opportunity to socialize with other parents. Soon,
								library visits became a cherished part of our routine.
								<br></br>
								<span className="tab-space"></span> When my daughter was born,
								we continued this tradition. Reading became an integral part of
								our family time, not just a milestone to achieve. Both my kids
								are now avid book lovers. They were accustomed to weekly library
								visits in the US, but after moving to India, they felt a
								significant void. Unfortunately, children's libraries are rare
								here, leading parents to buy books regularlyâ€”an expensive affair
								for families with enthusiastic young readers. <br></br>
								<span className="tab-space"></span>The idea of starting a
								library and activity center in Hyderabad was born from our
								return to India. My husband, an engineer, and I, a nutritionist,
								wanted to create something that involved working with kids. This
								library and activity center is our joint effort to instill the
								joy of reading in children. We aim to make book reading a
								delightful experience, helping children bond with like-minded
								peers. <br></br>
								<span className="tab-space"></span>As Kate DiCamillo wisely
								said, "Reading should not be presented to children as a chore or
								duty. It should be offered as a special gift." We hope to make
								joyful reading a lifelong habit for kids.
